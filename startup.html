                <p>A startup can either go for equity financing, debt financing or funding in the form of grants.</p>
                <b>Equity financing.</b>
                <p>Equity financing involves selling a portion of equity in return for funds. It does not have to be repaid. Startups have to give up a portion of their ownership to the investor. Equity Investors prefer to involve in the decision-making process.</p>
                <b>Debt Financing</b>
                <p>Borrowing money and paying it back with interest is involved in debt financing. The funds are to be repaid within a stipulated time frame with interest. The startup may need to provide a business asset as collateral. Debt Fund has very less involvement in decision-making.</p>
                <b>Grants</b>
                <p>A grant is an award, usually financial, given by an entity to a startup to facilitate a goal or incentivize performance. There is no component of repayment of the grants. The grant provider has no involvement in decision making.</p>

                <b>Incubator/Accelerators</b>
                <p>Incubators/Accelerators are like a parent to a child, who nurture the business by providing necessary tools, training and network to a startup.</p>
