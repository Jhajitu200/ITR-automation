                                                    For quick and efficient collection of taxes, the Income-tax Law has incorporated a system of deduction of tax at the point of generation of income. This system is called as “Tax Deduction at Source”, commonly known as TDS. Under this system tax is deducted at the origin of the income. Tax is deducted by the payer and is remitted to the Government by the payer on behalf of the payee. The provisions of deduction of tax at source are applicable to several payments such as salary, interest, commission, brokerage, professional fees, royalty, contract payments, etc. In respect of payments to which the TDS provisions apply, the payer has to deduct tax at source on the payments made by him and he has to deposit the tax deducted by him to the credit of the Government.

                                                    Yes. Payments may be made to you after TDS. You can adjust this against your final tax liability. You are also required to effect TDS while making business payments. Failure to do so will result in the entire expenditure being disallowed as your business expenditure and taxed as income

                                                    It is not mandatory to file NIL TDS return if no TDS has been deducted during the year/quarter. A declaration for non-filing of return has to be filed in this case. Declaration can be filed at tdscpc.gov.in, by logging in as 'Deductor' and going to 'Declaration for Non – filing of TDS statements' under the 'Statement/Payments' menu. Please also note that if the deductor has permanently closed his business, he/she should surrender his TAN before the jurisdictional AO.

However, the claim of TDS to be made in your return of income should be strictly as per the TDS credit being reflected in Form 26AS. If there is any discrepancy in the tax actually deducted and the tax credit being reflected in Form 26AS then you should intimate the same to the deductor and should reconcile the difference. The credit granted by the Income-tax Department will be as per Form 26AS.
