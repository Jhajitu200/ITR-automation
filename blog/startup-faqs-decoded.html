One route is getting acquired by larger companies for technology, market share, or talent. Successful startups may also consider an </span><strong>Initial Public Offering (IPO)</strong><span> to publicly list shares and raise capital while allowing exits. Secondary sales involve selling the startup's equity stake to private investors or venture capitalists, providing partial liquidity. A </span><strong>management buyout (MBO)</strong><span> is another option where the existing leadership team acquires the company, often with backing from external investors.</span></p><p>Startups may also repurchase or redeem shares from employees or early shareholders as a exit strategy. Considering exit pathways early allows founders to focus on building long-term company value and offer returns to backers.</p><p><strong>And that wraps up our deep dive into India's thriving startup ecosystem!</strong></p><p>For startups navigating this dynamic environment, having the right partners provides an invaluable edge.
