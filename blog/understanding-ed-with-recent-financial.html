This reflects tighter regulations and a push to clean up the lower levels of India’s financial system. The tightening of regulations has not only brought greater transparency but has also laid bare a series of accounting scandals and instances of tax evasion that have permeated the country’s financial fabric.</span></p><p>That’s what we’re here to talk about today, to understand what it is like to be ED in this world of crooks, and while we’re at it, we will look at some case studies on recent accounting scandals. Evading taxes is a fool’s errand, and as our regular readers, we always encourage compliance over complacency.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="../public/blog/e90a29b0-0472-447f-bc98-2a8aef1a0ca5_829x526.jpg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="../public/blog/e90a29b0-0472-447f-bc98-2a8aef1a0ca5_829x526.jpg"><img src="../public/blog/e90a29b0-0472-447f-bc98-2a8aef1a0ca5_829x526.jpg" data-attrs="../public/blog/e90a29b0-0472-447f-bc98-2a8aef1a0ca5_829x526.jpg" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="../public/blog/e90a29b0-0472-447f-bc98-2a8aef1a0ca5_829x526.jpg" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><h2><strong>Understanding the role of the Enforcement Directorate (ED)</strong></h2></blockquote><p>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is an influential organization in India whose primary objective is to combat financial crimes. It serves as a vigilant watchdog that extends its surveillance far and wide to expose and prosecute money laundering and other illicit economic activities. But how does the ED contribute to promoting ethical corporate governance in India?</p><p>To comprehend the ED's significance, it's important to understand how unethical practices like concealing illegal earnings or manipulating financial statements can damage a company's reputation and undermine the entire business environment. The ED serves as a potent deterrent, reminding everyone that engaging in shady financial dealings carries severe repercussions. By actively investigating and prosecuting such crimes, the ED helps cultivate a culture of transparency and integrity - two critical components of a healthy corporate ecosystem.</p><blockquote><h3><strong>Case Studies of Regulatory Lapses</strong></h3></blockquote><h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget"><strong>1.

The reason? A report stating the IT Department found bogus claims and excessive deductions was published during market hours, resulting in the stock price ending at a day low.</span></p><p><span>According to sources familiar with the matter, the Income Tax department has discovered that the company claimed excessive and false deductions for its manufacturing units in Sikkim. The company reportedly claimed bogus deductions amounting to approximately </span><strong>Rs 1,000 crore</strong><span> under special sections such as </span><strong>80 IC</strong><span>. It was also found that the pharmaceutical company made payments worth hundreds of crores of rupees to doctors and medical practitioners in exchange for prescriptions written for drugs made by Alkem Labs.</span></p><p><span>The I-T department conducted surveys on the offices and premises of Alkem Labs in September last year after receiving information about possible tax evasion by the firm. The investigation is still ongoing, and the</span><strong> Income Tax department </strong><span>is currently recording statements from relevant officials and scrutinizing the company's data and balance sheets. In response to media reports about the alleged tax evasion, Alkem Labs released a statement denying the allegations and stating that the information published is factually incorrect. The company further emphasized its commitment to compliance and transparency and mentioned that it has fully cooperated with the Income Tax department officials during the survey proceedings.</span></p><h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget"><strong>2.

So what went wrong with Vijay Shekhar Sharma’s brainchild Paytm?</p><p><span>In the years </span><strong>2014 and 2015, </strong><span>Paytm was highly sought after as a startup due to its innovative approach to digital payments and rapid growth in the Indian market, making headlines every other month. Paytm entered the market at a time when digital payments were still in their infancy, thereby allowing it to establish itself as a leader in the space by being an early player.</span></p><p><span>In </span><strong>November 2016,</strong><span> the Indian government announced the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes, which resulted in an upsurge in digital payments. Paytm, with its mobile wallet and digital payment services, made the most of this opportunity and witnessed a significant increase in user adoption and transaction volumes, thus becoming a super-successful business. However, two issues emerged:</span></p><p><span>Firstly, it was non-profitable, and secondly, the company decided to go public without any clear direction towards profitability. But if that wasn’t enough, the exponential growth of the </span><strong>United Payment Interface (UPI)</strong><span> disrupted Paytm’s wallet business.</span></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Enter Paytm Payments Bank (PPBL)</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Paytm Payments Bank operates as an independent entity and offers banking services such as savings accounts and debit cards. Despite being under the Paytm umbrella, the two entities have distinct roles – Paytm serves as a digital platform, while Paytm Payments Bank is a licensed financial institution.</p><p><span>Paytm's repeated hiccups with regulatory compliance suggest the truth of the saying, </span><strong>“Old habits die hard.”</strong><span> Paytm has a chronic problem with adhering to regulations and may struggle to implement effective compliance practices. Here are four instances from the past that have put the organization on the regulators’ radar:</span></p><ol><li><p>In 2018, RBI halted new accounts due to violations of licensing conditions, which included breaches of day-end balances and non-compliance with KYC guidelines.</p></li><li><p>In October 2021, PPBL was fined Rs 1 crore for submitting false information to the RBI.</p></li><li><p>In 2022, RBI found cybersecurity, KYC, and technology failures, prompting a customer onboarding freeze and audit. RBI also found the same servers were used for One 97 Communication entities and the bank - which is not allowed as per RBI guidelines.</p></li><li><p>Post-audit, PPBL faces a hefty fine in 2023 for continued KYC non-compliance.</p></li></ol><p><span>As for the present, the </span><strong>Reserve Bank of India (RBI)</strong><span> has imposed strict and sweeping restrictions on the payment bank business. These measures include immediately ceasing new deposits and credit transactions since </span><strong>February 29</strong><span>. The RBI took this decisive action after uncovering serious irregularities in KYC norms, compliance issues, and related party transactions. The RBI's thorough investigation was prompted by concerns about money laundering and questionable transactions involving substantial sums of money.</span></p><p><span>Reports indicate that </span><strong>Paytm's Payment Bank</strong><span> had numerous accounts lacking proper identification, with instances of multiple accounts being created using the same PAN. Furthermore, it was revealed that in some cases, the total transaction value exceeded crores, surpassing the regulatory limits for minimum KYC prepaid instruments. In light of these findings, the RBI has unequivocally directed Paytm Payments Bank to immediately cease accepting deposits or top-ups across various instruments since February 29, 2024.</span></p><p><span>And that's a wrap on the first part of accounting case studies!
