financial elements before making your decision.</p></li></ul><p>Let’s review the different forms of business and how each could impact you, your partners, earnings and the legacy of your business.</p><p></p><p><strong>Sole Proprietorship</strong></p><p>Sole Proprietorship is “A type of business unit where one person is solely responsible for providing the capital,&nbsp; bearing the risk of the&nbsp; enterprise and for management of the business.”</p><p><strong>CHARACTERISTICS OF SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP FORM OF BUSINESS ORGANISATION</strong></p><p><strong>(a) Single Ownership/One-man Control:</strong></p><p>A single-owner starts the business by bringing together all the resources. He runs the business as per his own will.</p><p><strong>(b) No Separation of Ownership and Management:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The owner manages the business as per his/her own skills and intelligence.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>There is no separation of ownership and management.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(c) Less Legal Formalities: :</strong></p><ul><li><p>The formation and operation do not involve any legal formalities.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Formation is quite easy and simple.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(d) No Separate Entity:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The businessman and the business enterprise are one and the same.</p></li><li><p>The businessman is responsible for everything that happens in his business unit.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(e) No Sharing of Profit and Loss:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The sole proprietor enjoys the profits alone.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>At the same time, entire loss is also borne by him.</p></li></ul><p><strong>MERITS OF SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP FORM OF BUSINESS ORGANISATION</strong></p><p><strong>(a) Easy to Form and Wind Up:</strong></p><ul><li><p>It is very easy and simple to form a sole proprietorship. No legal formalities are required to be undertaken.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, the business can be wound up any time as per the decision of the proprietor.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(b) Quick Decision and Prompt Action:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Nobody interferes in the affairs of the sole proprietary organization.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>He/she can take quick decisions on the various business issues and prompt action can be taken.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(c) Direct Motivation:</strong></p><ul><li><p>All the profit arising out of the business goes to the owner’s pocket.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>This motivates the proprietor to work hard and run the business efficiently.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(d) Flexibility in Operation:</strong></p><p>The expansion or curtailment of business activities does not require many formalities as in the case of other forms of business organization.</p><p><strong>(d) Maintenance of Business Secrets:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The business secrets are known only to the proprietor.</p></li><li><p>He is not required to disclose any information to others unless and until he himself so decides.</p></li><li><p>He is also not bound to publish his business accounts.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(e) Personal Touch:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Since the proprietor himself handles everything relating to business, it is easy to maintain a good personal contact with the users and employees.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>By knowing the likes, dislikes and tastes of the users, the proprietor can adjust his operations accordingly.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, as the employees are few and work directly under the proprietor, it helps in maintaining a harmonious relationship with them, and run the business smoothly.</p></li></ul><p><strong>LIMITATIONS OF SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP FORM OF BUSINESS ORGANISATION</strong></p><p><strong>(a) Limited Resources:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The proprietor has a limited capacity to raise funds for his business.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Being a single owner, it is not always possible for him to arrange sufficient funds from his own sources.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(b) Lack of Continuity:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The continuity of the business is linked with the life of the proprietor.</p></li><li><p>Illness, death or insolvency of the proprietor can lead to closure of the business.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(c) Unlimited Liability:</strong></p><ul><li><p>In the eyes of law, the proprietor and the business are one and the same.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Personal properties of the owner can be used to meet the business obligations and debts.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(d) Not Suitable for Large Scale Operations:</strong></p><p>Since the resources and the managerial ability is limited, sole proprietorship form of business organization is not suitable for large-scale business.</p><p><strong>(e) Limited Managerial Expertise:</strong></p><ul><li><p>A single person may not be an expert in all fields like, purchasing, selling, financing etc.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Because of limited financial resources, it is also not possible to engage professional expertise.</p></li></ul><p><strong>SUITABILITY OF SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP FORM OF BUSINESS ORGANISATION</strong></p><p>It can be stated that the sole proprietorship is suitable:</p><ul><li><p>Where the capital requirement is small and risk involved is limited.</p></li><li><p>Where the market is limited, localized and the users give importance to personal attention.</p></li><li><p>For the production of goods and services which involve manual skill e.g., handicrafts, filigree work, jewelry, tailoring, hair cutting, etc.</p></li></ul><p><span>Note: If your business operates in an industry where personal liability is more of a risk, you should </span><strong>avoid a sole proprietorship</strong><span> ownership structure.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><strong>The Joint Hindu Family (HUF)</strong></p><p><span>The Joint Hindu Family (JHF) business is a form of a business organization run by the Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), where the family members of </span><strong>3 successive generations own the business jointly</strong><span>. The head of the family known as Karta manages the business. The other members are called </span><strong>co-parceners</strong><span> and all of them have </span><strong>equal ownership right</strong><span> over the properties of the business.</span></p><p><span>The membership of the JHF is acquired by </span><strong>virtue of birth in the same family</strong><span>. There is no restriction for minors to become members of the business.</span></p><p><strong>CHARACTERISTICS</strong><span> OF Joint Hindu Family (HUF)</span></p><p>From the above discussion, it is clear that the HUF business has certain special characteristics which are as follows:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Formation: </strong><span>In JHF business, there must be at least two members in the family and the family should have some ancestral property. It is not created by an agreement but by operation of law.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Legal Status:</strong><span> The JHF business is a jointly owned business. It is governed by the Hindu Succession Act 1956.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Membership: </strong><span>In JHF business, outsiders are not allowed to become the coparcener.&nbsp; Only the members of an undivided family acquire co-partnership rights by birth.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Profit Sharing:</strong><span> All coparceners have equal share in the profits of the business.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Management:</strong><span> The business is managed by the senior most member of the family known as Karta. Other members do not have the right to participate in the management. The Karta has the authority to manage the business as per his own will and his ways of managing cannot be questioned. If the coparceners are not satisfied, the only remedy is to get the HUF status of the family dissolved by mutual agreement.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Liability: </strong><span>The liability of coparceners is limited to the extent of their share in the business. But the Karta has an unlimited liability. His personal property can also be utilised to meet the business liability.</span></p></li></ol><p><strong>Continuity: </strong><span>Death of any coparceners does not affect the continuity of business. Even on the death of the Karta, it continues to exist as the eldest of the coparceners takes the position of Karta. However, JHF business can be dissolved either through mutual agreement or by partition suit in the court.</span></p><p><strong>MERITS OF HUF:</strong></p><p><strong>Assured Shares in Profits: </strong><span>Every coparcener is assured of an equal share in the profits irrespective of his participation in the running of the business. This safeguards the interest of minor, sick, physically, and mentally challenged coparceners.</span></p><p><strong>Quick Decision:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The Karta enjoys full freedom in managing the business.</p></li><li><p>It enables him to take quick decisions without any interference.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Limited Liability of Members:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p>The liability of the coparceners except the Karta is limited to the extent of his share in the business.</p></li><li><p>This enables the members to run the business freely just by following the instructions or direction of the Karta.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Unlimited Liability of the Karta:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p>Because of the unlimited liability of the Karta, his personal properties are at stake in case the business fails to pay the creditors.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>This clause of JHF business allows the Karta to manage business most carefully and efficiently.</p></li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;Continued Existence:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p>The death or insolvency of any member does not affect the continuity of the business.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It can continue for a long period of time.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Tax Benefits: </strong><span>HUF is regarded as an independent assessee for tax purposes. The share of coparceners is not to be included in their individual income for tax purposes.</span></p><p><strong>LIMITATION OF HUF:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Limited Resources: </strong><span>JHF business has generally limited financial and managerial resource. Therefore, it is not considered suitable for large business.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Lack of Motivation:</strong><span> The coparceners get equal share in the profits of the business irrespective of their participation.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Scope for Misuse of Power: </strong><span>Since the Karta has absolute freedom to manage the business, there is scope for him to misuse it for his personal gains.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol><p><strong>Instability:</strong><span> The continuity of HUF business is always under threat. A small rift within the family may lead to partition.</span></p><p><strong>SUITABILITY OF HUF:</strong><span> It is suitable where the family inherits a running business and the members of the family want to continue that business jointly as a family business. Also, HUF is considered suitable for a business that requires limited financial and managerial resources and having a very limited area of operation. It is found that HUF is usually engaged in trading business, indigenous banking, small industry, and crafts etc.</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Partnership</strong></p><p><span>Partnership is an association of two or more persons who pool their financial and managerial resources, agree to carry on business and share its profit. The persons who form a partnership are individually known as partners and collectively a </span><strong>firm or partnership firm.</strong></p><p><strong>CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTNERSHIP:</strong></p><p>The various characteristics of partnership form can be summarised as follows:</p><p><strong>(a) Two or More Persons:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p>To form a partnership firm, atleast two persons are required.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The maximum limit on the number of persons is ten for banking business and 20 for other businesses.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>If the number exceeds the above limit, the partnership becomes illegal.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(b) Contractual Relationship:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p>Partnership is created by an agreement among the persons who have agreed to join hands.</p></li><li><p>Such persons must be competent to contract.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Minors, lunatics and insolvent persons are not eligible to become partners.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>A minor can have a share in the profits without any obligation for losses.</p></li><li><p>There must be an agreement among the partners to share the profits and losses of the business of the partnership firm.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(c) Existence of Lawful Business:</strong></p><ul><li><p><span>The business of which the persons have agreed to share the profit </span><strong>must be lawful</strong><span>.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p>Any agreement to indulge in smuggling, black marketing etc. cannot be called partnership business in the eyes of law.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(d) Principal-Agent Relationship:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><p>Every partner is the principal as well as the agent of the firm.</p></li><li><p>When a partner deals with other parties, he acts as an agent of other partners, and at the same time the other partners become the principal.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(e) Voluntary Registration:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p>The registration of partnership firm is not compulsory.</p></li><li><p>But an unregistered firm suffers from some limitations which makes it virtually compulsory to be registered.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Following are the limitations of an unregistered firm.</p></li></ul><ol><li><p><span>The firm cannot sue outsiders, although the outsiders can sue it.</span><br></p></li><li><p>In case of any dispute among the partners, it is not possible to settle the dispute through court of law.</p></li><li><p>The firm cannot claim adjustments for amount payable to, or receivable from, any other parties.</p></li></ol><p><strong>MERITS</strong><span> OF PARTNERSHIP FORM OF BUSINESS ORGANISATION</span></p><p><strong>(a) Easy to Form:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p>A partnership can be formed easily without many legal formalities.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It is not compulsory to get the firm registered.
